      "\n",
      "Italy is a popular tourist destination, and many locals in Rome (especially in the tourism and hospitality industry) speak basic to intermediate English. However, some interactions (e.g., with taxi drivers, in local markets, or at less touristy restaurants) may require basic Italian phrases or a translation app. Here are important tips for your language and communication needs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Useful Italian Phrases:**\n",
      "   - **Hello/Goodbye:** Ciao/Arrivederci\n",
      "   - **Thank you/You're welcome:** Grazie/Prego\n",
      "   - **Excuse me/Please:** Scusa/Per favore\n",
      "   - **How much does it cost?:** Quanto costa?\n",
      "   - **Do you speak English?:** Parla inglese?\n",
      "   - **I don’t understand:** Non capisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Translation Apps:**\n",
      "   - Install a reliable translation app like Google Translate ahead of your trip. Download the Italian language pack for offline use, just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Restaurant Menus:**\n",
      "   - While many restaurants in tourist-heavy areas provide English menus, having familiarity with common Italian dishes might enhance your dining experience (e.g., *Cacio e Pepe*, *Carbonara*, *Amatriciana*).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Signage and Public Transport:**\n",
      "   - Most public transportation signs are in Italian, but major metro stops and some other services include English translations. Learning simple terms like *fermata* (stop) and *uscita* (exit) is helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Politeness Counts:**\n",
      "   - It’s always appreciated when tourists attempt to greet or thank locals in Italian. A little effort often goes a long way in creating goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
